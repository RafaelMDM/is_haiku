## What is a haiku?

From [wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haiku):

Haiku is a type of short form poetry that originated in Japan. 
Traditional Japanese haiku consist of three phrases composed of 17 
phonetic units (called on in Japanese, which are similar to syllables) 
in a 5, 7, 5 pattern that include a kireji, or "cutting word" and a kigo, or seasonal reference.
Similar poems that do not adhere to these rules are generally classified as senryÅ«.

## Usage

```bash
cat haiku | is_haiku
